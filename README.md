Identifying Interesting Documents for Reddit using Recommender Techniques

A Reddit agent that will automatically search the web for interesting text content to share to a
subreddit it has been trained on. The agent will make use of a number of machine learning and natural language 
processing techniques to achieve this goal.

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/KillaW0lf04/Reddit-Recommender-Bot/wiki) out for notes on performance and general observations made.

A detailed and organised list of items which need to be developed can be viewed in the issues section. The issues section also contains work in progress evalautive results that will eventually be compiled into the wiki once complete.
