======================

Identifying Interesting Documents for Reddit using Recommender Techniques

A Reddit agent that will automatically search the web for interesting text content to share to a
subreddit it has been trained on. The agent will make use of a number of machine learning and natural language 
processing techniques to achieve this goal.

All past and future notes about the project and observations made can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/KillaW0lf04/Reddit-Recommender-Bot/wiki). This can be cloned locally using github if required using `git clone git@github.com:KillaW0lf04/Reddit-Recommender-Bot.wiki.git`

A detailed and organised list of items which need to be developed can be viewed in the issues section. The issues section also contains work in progress evalautive results that will eventually be compiled into the wiki once complete.
